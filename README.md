Maksim Eren is a graduate Computer Science student at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) and a [Scholarship for Service CyberCorps](https://www.sfs.opm.gov) alumnus. He graduated Summa Cum Laude with a Computer Science Bachelor's at UMBC in 2020 and Master's in 2022. He has held multiple internships, which have ranged from incident response and software engineering at Montgomery County Government (MCGov), a research assistantship at CyberPacks, to a teaching and research assistantship at UMBC's [DREAM Lab](https://umbc-dream-lab.github.io). At MCGov, Maksim investigated and responded to hundreds of cyber incidents, and has developed several dashboards and incident analysis tools for the security operations center. Currently, he is working as a Scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).

His interdisciplinary research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and cybersecurity, with a concentration in tensor decomposition. His tensor decomposition-based research projects include large-scale malware detection and characterization, cyber anomaly detection, data privacy, and topic modeling and evolution of scientific articles. Maksim has developed and published state-of-the-art solutions in anomaly detection and malware characterization. He has also worked on various other machine learning research projects such as detecting malicious hidden code, adversarial analysis of malware classifiers, and federated learning. At LANL, Maksim was a member of the [2021 R&D 100](https://www.rdworldonline.com/2021-rd-100-award-winners/) winning project [SmartTensors](https://www.lanl.gov/collaboration/smart-tensors/), where he has released a fast tensor decomposition and anomaly detection software, and contributed to the design of various other tensor decomposition libraries.
