**Maksim E. Eren** is an early career scientist in the Information Systems and Modeling (A-1) group at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and a LANL Center for National Security and International Studies (CNSIS) Fellow. He is an alumnus of the [Scholarship for Service CyberCorps](https://www.sfs.opm.gov) program. Maksim graduated *Summa Cum Laude* with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) in 2020 and earned his Masterâ€™s degree from the same institution in 2022. In 2024, he received his Ph.D. from UMBC, focusing on tensor decomposition methods for malware characterization.

Maksim's research interests span an interdisciplinary set of topics in artificial intelligence (AI) and applied data science. He is particularly interested in leveraging machine learning to address challenges across diverse domains, including biology and cybersecurity. Maksim's work in AI and data science include tensor decomposition, pattern extraction, natural language modeling (NLP), malware characterization, anomaly detection, text mining, large language models (LLMs), knowledge graphs (KGs), high-performance computing (HPC), and data privacy. In addition to research, Maksim actively develops high-performance software and efficient machine learning (ML) pipelines optimized for extra-large datasets and real-world applications. At LANL, Maksim was a member of the [2021 R&D 100](https://www.rdworldonline.com/2021-rd-100-award-winners/) winning project [SmartTensors AI](https://smart-tensors.lanl.gov), where he has released a fast tensor decomposition and anomaly detection software, contributed to the design and development of various other tensor decomposition libraries, and developed state-of-the-art text mining tools.
